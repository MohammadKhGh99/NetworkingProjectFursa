Local DNS Server IP
-------------------
We can't use "route -n" in private instance, because it is not installed and we can't install it,
because private instance has no access to internet.
When entering "/etc/resolv.conf" file we got that DNS local server has the IP address "127.0.0.53",
and the same local DNS server's IP address for public instance.


Default gateway IP
-------------------
We try to run "route -n" and we got that the default gateway is "10.0.0.1".
But in private instance there is no, because it don't have access to internet.



DHCP IP allocation sys-logs
-------------------
1- Discover: 2024-05-21T19:04:31.625915+00:00 ip-10-0-0-232 dhcpcd[432]: enX0: soliciting a DHCP lease
* The instance wants IP address from DHCP.

2- Offer: 2024-05-21T19:04:31.625918+00:00 ip-10-0-0-232 dhcpcd[432]: enX0: offered 10.0.0.232 from 10.0.0.1
* The DHCP offers an IP address to the instance.

3- Request & Acknowledge: 2024-05-21T19:04:31.625922+00:00 ip-10-0-0-232 dhcpcd[432]: enX0: leased 10.0.0.232 for 3600 seconds
* The instance "indirectly" requested the offered IP address from DHCP,
  then the DHCP gave the instance the requested IP address and "Acknowledged" the IP address for 3600 seconds.

4- Acknowledge: 2024-05-21T19:04:31.625925+00:00 ip-10-0-0-232 dhcpcd[432]: enX0: adding route to 10.0.0.0/24
* As one of the phases of Acknowledgment, DHCP added the requested IP address to IP addresses of the subnet.



Public to private num of hops
-------------------
one hop.
* this one hop is the packets that sent from public to private indicates that the packets has successfully reached
  the destination but no response has got so there are no more hops.


DNS queries from the private instance
-------------------
Yes we can resolve DNS address of a public website from the private instance.
Both public and private instances are in the same VPC, so they have the same local DNS server and has cache,
so the private instance got the DNS address from the cache of the local DNS server.
* dig command works fine in the private instance.
